## Course Requirements
- How do I approach designing software?
> Careful planning and thinking is important when designing software. Software development can quickly become overwhelming. That is why development teams prioritize organization. It is easy to code, but difficult to design, develop, and produce. Trello became an invaluable tool during my development. Organizing my thoughts on what needed to be implemented in the project. These tactics can easily be applied to any software development team. Planning and staying organized should be on every developer's utility belt.
- How do I approach developing programs?
> Writing small code everyday. I noticed late into the course that coding all day was impacting my quality. It isn’t about finishing but about the quality of the final outcome that I was trying to achieve. Iteration was all too familiar. Since implementing something on the first try was never up to standard. I always had to go through multiple iterations; this was the only way to have functioning code that worked. Modularization is what I learned throughout the project. However, I learned that far too late into the project to reap the benefits.
- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
> Computer science gave me my goals. After my service in the military I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I stumbled across an Android application on my Pixel 2 XL; that application was a Python integrated development environment. I quickly realized how exciting programming was. I slowly realized that programming was just the tip of the iceberg. My initial goal was to be a great developer. However, I realized that being a great developer isn’t important in software development. It is being a great teammate. Working with others to achieve above what a great developer can do.
